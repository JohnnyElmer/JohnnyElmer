Hello!

My name is Johnny Elmér and I'm an MT student at Linköping University. 
This is a profile I use to keep track of anything from projects to labs. 

I hope that you'll find the code here interesting or helpful, depending on why you are looking at it.

If you are interested in looking at projects I have been apart of but don't own the repository to, feel free to look at the following:

TNM034 - Avancerad bildbehandling (2021): https://github.com/Skrivmaskinen/ABoB-face-recognition
TNM049 - Medietekniskt kandidatprojekt (2021): https://github.com/fredrikburmester/tnm094-project
TNM085 - Modelleringsprojekt (2021): https://github.com/jennyrudemo/NewtonsCradle
TNM040 - Kommunikation och användargränssnitt (2019): https://github.com/davidstyrbjorn/koma-projekt

Do take into account that since I was only a part of each group I cannot promise that I understand all parts of the code or even remember exactly what it was I did on each particular one.
